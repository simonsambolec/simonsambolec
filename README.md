## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub.\
You can find my CV [here](https://simonsambolec.github.io/simonsambolec/Simon_Sambolec_CV.pdf).

## My Projects

### RoomCodes
RoomCodes is a full-stack SaaS application for small accommodation hosts, enabling them to manage guest information via QR codes linked to digital welcome pages.\
It includes features such as content auto-translation, online check-in, AI-powered guest assistance, team notifications and more.

The project was built using Angular, NestJS, Azure services and Heroku, with automated deployment and subscription management through LemonSqueezy. It was a great learning experience in designing, developing, and deploying a complete SaaS platform.

I eventually abandoned the project since I wasnâ€™t interested in marketing it further, but it was a great learning experience.

### YoutubeLongs
This is a Chrome extension which adds random gameplay footage under Youtube videos.\
Why would anyone want that?\
There is a popular short video format - 2 videos playing at once. \
Top video has boring scene, but interesting talk. \
Bottom video has footage that keeps you hooked, but no sound.

It was made as a joke, published to Chrome Store and has had over 2000 active installations.\
It has since been removed from the store as I did not provide updates.

### Hydrant Manager
Hydrant Manager is a web application developed as my diploma project in 2023. It provides an interactive map for managing fire hydrants. Users can add new hydrants, log maintenance checks, and view their status directly on the map.
